This project allows to learn relations among variables starting from collected data. 

To learn relations just run StructureLearning.mat. Data needed to run the algorithm can be generated using the DCSimulation project (https://github.com/monicavit164/dcSimulation). An example of each file can be found in the directory sampleData.

The function inferenceModule.mat can be used for testing the ability of the network to infer the states of the variables modeled.
